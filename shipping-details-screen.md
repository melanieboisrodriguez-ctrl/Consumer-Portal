# Shipping Details Screen

The image displays a mobile application screen titled "Shipping Details," designed with a clean, modern aesthetic featuring a white background and accents of green and gray.

## Top Navigation Bar

At the very top, there's a header bar. On the left, a green stylized logo (resembling a '3' or a stacked 'E'). To its right, the text "FR" (likely indicating French language selection). Further right are three icons: a magnifying glass (search), a bell (notifications), and three horizontal lines (menu).

## Shipping Details Section

Below the header, the main content begins with the bold black title "Shipping Details."
